# VRChat Udon Prefabs and Scripts

A collection of Unity Prefabs and Udon Scripts which I often use while building worlds for VRChat.

You can find their respective `unitypackage` in the [prefabs](./prefabs/) directory.

You can find a demo Unity project in the [demo-world](./demo-world/) directory.

## Prefabs

### Notifications

This prefab allows you to show the player some kind of notification. This could be used for showing the use a notification when they complete a quest or an achievement.

### Respawner

This prefab simply contains a collider and a respawn point which you can place freely throughout your world. This could be used to create a custom respawn height and respawn point when the player falls of a platform without relying on the worlds default respawn height.
